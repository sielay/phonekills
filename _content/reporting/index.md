# General rules

 1. To report an incident, you need some form of tangible evidence. Ideally, that would be a video recording, but sound or picture can sometimes be good.
 1. While reporting, you **MUST** ensure you don't put yourself or others in danger and that you don't commit an offence or a crime yourself. Any evidence submitted to the force can be used against you.
 1. You should refrain from using foul language and any form of harassment. If it happens you say something wrong, ensure you apologise for it at least while reporting. If the event would result in the court case, remember about repeating your apology and clarification.
 1. Try not to engage, and deescalate any occurred tension.

<div class="text-xs text-gray-600 ml-4 mt-2 bg-gray-300 p-2 leading-4 italic">Comment: In many videos, including mine, you see engagement or argument. It's not the right approach, and very often, we shouldn't do that. We learned that by losing some cases or being warned of our behaviour. Try to learn from our experience.</div>

# Use of a mobile device while driving

 1. It's illegal to hold a phone or sat nav while driving or riding a motorcycle ([source](https://www.gov.uk/using-mobile-phones-when-driving-the-law)).
 1. If your vehicle isn't parked with the engine turned off by a key (not start-stop feature), then you're still driving.
 1. If you supervise a learner driver, the same rules apply too.
 1. If your phone or other display is not used as a handheld device but distracts you, you can still be fined.

# Observing the driver that uses a mobile device

 1. Ensure you're positioned safely, not obstructing anyone and not causing any danger.
 1. Try to not engage and remain not noticed as long as possible.
 1. Ensure your camera captures interaction with the device.
 1. If it's safe, wait before the vehicle moves.
 1. For reporting this offence, you don't need two minutes before or two minutes after the event, as long you're only a witness of the event.

 # Observing any other offence on the road

 1. If the offence included interaction with your or your vehicle, ensure you capture two minutes before and after the event. This way, you can prove that you did not cause the events.
 1. Events that typically don't require extra minutes include red light jumping, ignoring signs, use of the handheld device.
 1. Events that typically require extra minutes are close passes, hooks, collisions, abuses.
 1. Do everything to not engage, stay calm and not cause danger or disturbance.

 # Reporting and testifying about close passes

The Highway Code gives a visual presentation in section 183 of how the car should pass the cyclist. Anyhow, because those cases are sometimes resolved by Magistrate Courts the result may not be easy to achieve. It's because Magistrates are just members of the public, and aren't trained in technical and legal details.

 1. It's difficult to have a result of a close pass when you are on a different lane than the car overtaking you. That counts even when your wheels are on a narrow painted cycle lane.
 1. Magistrates and Legal Advisors very often don't understand the concept and guidance around the primary position or about the suggested 1.5m distance.
 1. You need a frame of reference to prove the distance. For that reason, it's best if you have a low positioned rear camera.

 # Reporting to police

 1. Police has 14 days to send a Notice of Intended Prosecution to the registered keeper of the vehicle. Ensure you file your report as soon as possible (less than ten days).
 1. Don't edit the footage. If it's too big for the police system, you can cut it into parts. In such a situation, you need to confirm this form of edit while reporting.
 1. Find which force covers are where the event occurred and find their dashcam upload service.
 1. You will need to provide your details like address, names and date of birth. Some forces may ask irrelevant and distressing questions like ethnic background.
 1. You need to provide a location where the offence occurred, as well as time and date.
 1. You will be asked to describe weather and road conditions, tell what happened and what is visible on the evidence.
 1. If the system has a problem accepting your video, upload it to the cloud file storage. Ensure that the video is not publicly available.
 1. You will have to confirm that you agree to be summoned as a witness if the case ends up in court. If you wouldn't do this, the police won't act as CPS won't even take it.


#  What happens next

 1. You will get a report number, don't share it with anyone.
 1. Some forces like MET will tell you if they will look into the cause.
 1. Police will decide to either do nothing (No Further Action, NFA), send a warning letter or send a Notice of Intended Prosecution to a registered keeper (NIP).
 1. If the keeper won't name the driver after receiving NIP, the CPS will open a court case against them. In most situations, this ends up in a high fine of 6 points on their licence and financial costs summing close to a thousand pounds.
 1. If the driver is named, they may be offered a Fixed Penalty Notice (FPN) relevant to the offence. FPN, in most cases, include points on their licence. The driver can be offered a Driver Awareness Course, which usually cost around 100 pounds and results in no points awarded. The course can be taken only once in few years.
 1. If the driver won't accept the offer, the case goes to CPS, which usually will take it to the magistrate court.
 1. You may be summoned as a witness to the court, but it may not happen. You may be contacted in preparation to be summoned, but never actually get the invitation. The driver can plea guilty, the case can be dropped, a fine may be awarded in the absence or CPS may decide they don't need your help.
 1. Regardless of the result, once the case lands with CPS you will get an update on it. You may never get an update if the report is resolved between the police and the driver.

 # How long it takes

 1. It may take few weeks before you hear from the Police force.
 1. It may take over 6 months to be informed, that the report is redirected to CPS.
 1. It will take over a year for report to conclude in case, if it ends up in the court.

 # What to consider before publishing footage on the social media
An official response from PNLD to question about publishing video of drivers committing offences (Sep 13th, 2019)

> Thank you for your enquiry
> 
> We would advise against publishing an image/footage of a suspect on social media, as this may compromise the investigation and leave you open to civil action for defamation.
> 
> It is possible for the police to publish the image in controlled circumstances that would achieve the same objectives. You would then be protected from civil action and the police publication would be monitored and subject to strict guidelines. This allows the police to make use of social media in the same way as the individual but would ensure avoidance of the commission of any offences under the Contempt of Court Act 1981 and would also avoid any conflict with the Convention rights of the suspect, such as a right to a fair trial should a suspect be charged with an offence.

> If you have footage of a traffic incident, we advise you pass this to your local police force. You can contact your local police force either via 101, in person at your nearest police station or via their online reporting form: https://www.askthe.police.uk/content/Q727.htm
